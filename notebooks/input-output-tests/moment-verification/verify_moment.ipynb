    "# Verifying the Projection of Moments with Signal MC\n",
    "As found [previously](../moment-projection/moment_projection.ipynb), the projected moments have some missing factors causing them not to match expectations. A direct fit to data with moments as the parameters is now available for use, and so we can use those as \"truth\" information to compare our projected moments to. The fitted moments do have issues in obtaining moments with $>1\\%$ contribution, but having ~8 moments should be enough to track down the missing factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will proceed as follows:\n",
    "1. Generate Signal Monte Carlo (MC) according to a pseudo-realistic set of waves (no acceptance effects i.e. *thrown*)\n",
    "   1. 35% polarization and in the PARA_0 orientation\n",
    "2. Fit MC with same waveset, and obtain a fit result that should match the generated wave values\n",
    "3. Project moments from the fit result to obtain a projected moment-set $H_{\\text{proj}}$\n",
    "4. Fit MC with the same number of moments, and obtain a fitted moment-set $H_{\\text{fit}}$\n",
    "5. Compare the fit and projected sets to investigate the missing factors."
