    "# Verifying the Projection of Moments with Signal MC\n",
    "As found previously, the projected moments have some missing factors causing them not to match expectations. Since then, two major updates have occured:\n",
    "1. I've developed a direct fit to data using moments as AmpTools parameters, which should now provide a set of \"true\" values we can compare the projected moments to.\n",
    "   <br>a. Has issues in extracting moments with $>1\\%$ contribution, but this should be enough to track down factors\n",
    "2. The old python projection script has now been replaced by a c++ version, that also includes the necessary normalization integrals\n",
    "   a. The script may likely be updated over time, so check the commit hash for what version to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will proceed as follows:\n",
    "1. Generate Signal Monte Carlo (MC) according to a pseudo-realistic set of waves (no acceptance effects i.e. *thrown*)\n",
    "   <br>a. 35% polarization and in the PARA_0 orientation\n",
    "2. Fit MC with same waveset, and obtain a fit result that should match the generated wave values\n",
    "3. Project moments from the fit result to obtain a projected moment-set $H_{\\text{proj}}$\n",
    "4. Fit MC with the same number of moments, and obtain a fitted moment-set $H_{\\text{fit}}$\n",
    "5. Compare the fit and projected sets to investigate the missing factors."
