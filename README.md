# Introduction

 :bangbang:**This repository must be on a JLab ifarm node**:bangbang:

Within this repository lies all scripts needed to perform a full partial wave analysis of the neutral $\omega\pi^0$ channel from start to finish, which is dominated by a neutral $b_1$ resonance for which this repo is named after. 

# Setup
TODO: describe the setup here. Currently uv and makefile are used separately to build the python and cpp bindings, but I may want to combine these into one command for ease of construction

# Documentation
TODO: Describe where to find documentation, and maybe a short description of how to make it. Might want to use sphinx + doxygen [as described here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clear-functional-c-documentation-with-sphinx-breathe-doxygen-cmake/), but need to look into other suggestions for easiest solution to making dual c++/python docs
