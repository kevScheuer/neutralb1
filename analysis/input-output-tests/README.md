Folder containing all Monte Carlo "Input-Output tests". These are effectively tests of the intensity models performance, where Monte Carlo is generated from the intensity model (using parameters from real fits to data or fake ones) and the MC data is fit by the model. The parameter set that was originally used to generate the MC is then the "truth" information that we expect the fit result to replicate
