This study serves a dual purpose role
1. Observe the effects of adding a $J^P=0^-$ wave to the fit config, that was *not* generated in the original Monte Carlo data. If fit results are significantly affected by this change then it can be determined that a $0^-$ wave can not be uniquely described when it comes to real data
2. A first experience with bootstrapping fits, and analyzing fit results using them.

As such, the notebooks contained within this directory may focus quite a bit on the bootstrap plots and viewing of them
