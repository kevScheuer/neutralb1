    "# Comparing the effects of a $p\\pi^0$ mass cut on PWA Results\n",
    "In the higher $\\omega\\pi^0$ mass region, baryon excitations become noticeable in the $p\\pi^0$ mass spectrum. While we don't fit the $p\\pi^0$ mass we *do* fit the $\\cos\\theta$ distribution, and these excited baryon events (typically $\\Delta$'s) will appear at $\\cos\\theta\\sim 1$. This happens as $\\cos\\theta$ measures the angle of of the $\\omega$ in the resonance rest frame, so values close to 1 mean the $\\pi^0$ is moving close to the proton, which happens when they are the decay products of an $N^\\ast$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will analyze what effects will occur when these excitations, specifically events whose $p\\pi^0$ mass is $<1.4~GeV$, are removed. Later on this ideally will flow into a full systematic study of this cut, but for now we can see the effect of this harsh mass cut. The style and structure will be *very* similar to the [compare orientations notebook](./compare_orientations.ipynb).\n",

    "Some Fit details are given below:\n",
    "* Bins: \n",
    "  * $t$ = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9]\n",
    "  * mass = 1.0 - 1.5, 20 MeV bins\n",
