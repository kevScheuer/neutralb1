Using the [batch scripts](../submission/batch_scripts/) we now have plenty of `.fit` files that need analyzing. The common directory [scripts](./scripts) is where all the common scripts are needed to aggregate data. The primary one is [fitsToCsv.C](./scripts/fitsToCsv.C), which uses AmpTools' FitResults class to create a csv of all the `.fit` files you want to analyze. Its recommended to print out its help message to better understand how to use the file: `root -l 'fitsToCsv.C("-h")'`. The other important file is [`pwa_tools.py`](./scripts/pwa_tools.py) which houses the `plotter` class. This class is the main workhorse of the analysis, generating any set of standard plots one may be interested in.

You will also find additional folders for individual studies performed. Each of these studies contains a `README.md` to provide context for its motivations and details. Each study primarily uses notebooks for its analysis, to provide a more interactive and readable method of analyzing the fit results
