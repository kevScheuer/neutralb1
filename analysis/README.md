Using the [batch scripts](../submission/batch_scripts/) we now have plenty of `.fit` files that need analyzing. The directories can be described like:
* [scripts](./scripts): All the common scripts needed to aggregate data. The primary one is [fitsToCsv.C](./scripts/fitsToCsv.C), which uses AmpTools' FitResults class to create a csv of all the `.fit` files you want to analyze. 
  * Its recommended to print out its help message to better understand how to use the file: `root -l 'fitsToCsv.C("-h")'`
* [data](./data): Holds all the `.csv` or other raw data files that we will primarily analyze in...
* [notebooks!](./notebooks/): where most of the magic happens. The intention is for [scripts](./scripts) to handle all the most common plotting type functions, and notebooks to handle the research notes and plots for presentations all in one.
