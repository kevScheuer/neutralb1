neutralb1 documentation
=======================

Welcome to the documentation for the neutralb1 project! This project contains all the
scripts necessary to perform a combined partial wave and moment analysis of the 
photoproduced :math:`{\omega\pi^0}` channel. The channel is dominated by the neutral 
:math:`{b_1(1235)}` meson, for which the project is named after. This is the author's
thesis project, and so is a continuing work in progress.
